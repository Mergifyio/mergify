   GitHub does not allow to request more 15 users or teams for a review.

The ``request_reviews`` action requests reviews from users for the pull
request.

ðŸ‘€ Flexible Reviewers Assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can assign people for review based on any criteria you like. A classic is
to use the name of modified files to do it:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pull_request_rules:
      - name: ask jd to review changes on python files
        conditions:
          - files~=\.py$
          - -closed
        actions:
          request_reviews:
            users:
              - jd

You can also ask entire teams to review a pull request based on, e.g., labels:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pull_request_rules:
      - name: ask the security team to review security labelled PR
        conditions:
          - label=security
        actions:
          request_reviews:
            teams:
              - "@myorg/security-dev"
              - "@myorg/security-ops"


ðŸ‘˜ Random Review Assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|premium plan tag|
|essential plan tag|

It's not fair to ask for the same users or teams to always do the review. You
can rather randomly assign a pull request to a group of users.

.. code-block:: yaml

    pull_request_rules:
      - name: ask the security team to review security labelled PR
        conditions:
          - label=security
        actions:
          request_reviews:
            users:
              - jd
              - sileht
              - CamClrt
              - GuillaumeOj
           random_count: 2

In that case, 2 users from this list of 4 users will get a review requested for
this pull request.

If you prefer some users to have a larger portion of the pull requests
assigned, you can add a weight to the user list:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pull_request_rules:
      - name: ask the security team to review security labelled PR
        conditions:
          - label=security
        actions:
          request_reviews:
            users:
              jd: 2
              sileht: 3
              CamClrt: 1
              GuillaumeOj: 1
          random_count: 2

In that case, it's 3 times more likely then the user ``sileht`` will get a pull
request assigned rather than ``GuillaumeOj``.
