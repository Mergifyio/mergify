   * - ``assignees``
     - list of :ref:`data type template`
     -
     - Users to assign the newly created pull request. As the type is
       :ref:`data type template`, you could use, e.g., ``{{author}}`` to assign
       the pull request to its original author.
   * - ``title``
     - :ref:`data type template`
     - ``{{ title }} (copy #{{ number }})``
     - The pull request title.


As the ``title`` is a :ref:`template <data type template>`, you can
leverage any pull request attributes to use as content, e.g. ``{{author}}``.
You can also use this additional variable:

    * ``{{ destination_branch }}``: the name of destination branch.

Examples

üîÅ Copy a Pull Request to Another Branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following rule copies a pull request from the ``staging`` branch to the
``prod`` branch as soon as the CI passes and a label ``ready for prod`` is set
on the pull request:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pull_request_rules:
      - name: copy pull request when CI passes
        conditions:
          - base=staging
          - check-success=test
          - label=ready for prod
        actions:
          copy:
            branches:
              - prod

.. include:: ../global-substitutions.rst
