üîÅ Copy a Pull Request to Another Branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following rule copies a pull request from the ``staging`` branch to the
``prod`` branch as soon as the CI passes and a label ``ready for prod`` is set
on the pull request:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pull_request_rules:
      - name: copy pull request when CI passes
        conditions:
          - base=staging
          - check-success=test
          - label=ready for prod
        actions:
          copy:
            branches:
              - prod

.. include:: ../global-substitutions.rst
