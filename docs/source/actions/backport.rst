.. _backport action:

backport
=========

It is common for software to have (some of) their major versions maintained
over an extended period. Developers usually create stable branches that are
maintained for a while by cherry-picking patches from the development branch.

This process is called *backporting* as it implies that bug fixes merged into
the development branch are ported back to the stable branch(es). The stable
branch can then be used to release a new minor version of the software, fixing
some of its bugs.

   |essential plan tag|
   If the repository is bigger than 512 MB, the ``backport`` action is only
   available for `Essential and Premium subscribers <https://mergify.io/pricing>`_.

As this process of backporting patches can be tedious, Mergify automates this
mechanism to save developers' time and ease their duty.

The ``backport`` action copies the pull request into another branch *once the
pull request has been merged*.

Once the backporting pull request is closed or merged, Mergify will
automatically delete the backport head branch that it created.

You can also trigger backports using the :ref:`backport command` command.

   * - Key Name
     - Value Type
     - Default
     - Value Description
   * - ``branches``
     - list of string
     - ``[]``
     - The list of branches the pull request should be copied to.
   * - ``regexes``
     - list of string
     - ``[]``
     - The list of regexes to find branches the pull request should be copied
       to.
   * - ``ignore_conflicts``
     - Boolean
     - ``true``
     - Whether to create the pull requests even if they are conflicts when
       cherry-picking the commits.
   * - ``labels``
     - list of string
     - ``[]``
     - The list of labels to add to the created pull requests.
   * - ``label_conflicts``
     - string
     - ``conflicts``
     - The label to add to the created pull request if it has conflicts and
       ``ignore_conflicts`` is set to ``true``.
   * - ``assignees``
     - list of :ref:`data type template`
     -
     - Users to assign the newly created pull request. As the type is
       :ref:`data type template`, you could use, e.g., ``{{author}}`` to assign
       the pull request to its original author.
   * - ``title``
     - :ref:`data type template`
     - ``{{ title }} (backport #{{ number }})``
     - The pull request title.


As the ``title`` is a :ref:`template <data type template>`, you can
leverage any pull request attributes to use as content, e.g. ``{{author}}``.
You can also use this additional variable:

    * ``{{ destination_branch }}``: the name of destination branch.

üë©‚Äçüîß Using Labels to Backport Pull-Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copying pull requests to a maintenance branch is a common workflow. In order to
elect a pull request to be backported, it's possible to use a label. With a
rule such as the one below, you can trigger a backport as soon as the label is
added and the pull request merged:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pull_request_rules:
      - name: backport patches to stable branch
        conditions:
          - base=master
          - label=backport-to-stable
        actions:
          backport:
            branches:
              - stable
            assignees: 
              - "{{ author }}"

.. include:: ../global-substitutions.rst
