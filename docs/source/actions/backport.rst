.. _backport action:

backport
=========

It is common for software to have (some of) their major versions maintained
over an extended period. Developers usually create stable branches that are
maintained for a while by cherry-picking patches from the development branch.

This process is called *backporting* as it implies that bug fixes merged into
the development branch are ported back to the stable branch(es). The stable
branch can then be used to release a new minor version of the software, fixing
some of its bugs.

As this process of backporting patches can be tedious, Mergify automates this
mechanism to save developers' time and ease their duty.

The ``backport`` action copies the pull request into another branch *once the
pull request has been merged*.

Once the backporting pull request is closed or merged, Mergify will
automatically delete the backport head branch that it created.

You can also trigger backports using the :ref:`backport command` command.

üë©‚Äçüîß Using Labels to Backport Pull-Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copying pull requests to a maintenance branch is a common workflow. In order to
elect a pull request to be backported, it's possible to use a label. With a
rule such as the one below, you can trigger a backport as soon as the label is
added and the pull request merged:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pull_request_rules:
      - name: backport patches to stable branch
        conditions:
          - base=master
          - label=backport-to-stable
        actions:
          backport:
            branches:
              - stable

.. include:: ../global-substitutions.rst
