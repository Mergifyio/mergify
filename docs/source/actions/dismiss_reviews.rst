.. _dismiss_reviews action:

dismiss_reviews
===============

The ``dismiss_reviews`` action removes reviews done by collaborators when the
pull request is updated. This is especially useful to make sure that a review
does not stay when the branch is updated (e.g., new commits are added or the
branch is rebased).

ðŸ¥¶ Removing Stale Reviews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a pull request is updated, GitHub does not remove the (possibly) outdated
reviews approvals or changes request. It's a good idea to remove them as soon
as the pull request gets updated with new commits.

.. code-block:: yaml

    pull_request_rules:
      - name: remove outdated reviews
        conditions:
          - base=master
        actions:
          dismiss_reviews:

You could also only dismiss the outdated reviews if the author is not a member
of a particular team. This allows to keep the approval if the author is
trusted, even if they update their code:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pull_request_rules:
      - name: remove outdated reviews for non trusted authors
        conditions:
          - base=master
          - author!=@mytrustedteam
        actions:
          dismiss_reviews:
