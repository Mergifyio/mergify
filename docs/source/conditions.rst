=============
ðŸŽ¯ Conditions
=============

Conditions are used in pull request rules and queue rules to check if a pull
request matches a certain rule. If a pull request matches all of the listed
conditions in a rule, the subsequent actions listed in that rule will be
applied. Conditions must be listed under the ``conditions`` section of the
``pull_request_rules`` or ``queue_rules`` entries â€” see :ref:`configuration file format`.

Grammar
~~~~~~~

A condition is a string that has the following format::

  [ "-" ] [ "#" ] <attribute> [ <operator> <value> ]

- The optional ``-`` prefix is equivalent to the `not` operator.

- The optional ``#`` prefix indicates to consider the length of the attribute
  value rather than its content.

- An ``attribute`` is a property of a pull request, such as its author, its
  title or its base branch.

- An ``operator`` is used to determine how the match between the pull request's
  ``attribute`` and the defined ``value`` occurs.

For example:

- ``author=jd`` evaluates to true if the GitHub login of the author of the pull
  request is ``jd``.

- ``base~=^stable/`` matches any pull request whose base branch matches the
  regular expression ``^stable/``.

- ``approved-reviews-by=sileht`` matches if the user ``sileht`` is in the list
  of contributors who approved the pull request.

- ``#approved-reviews-by>=2`` matches if at least 2 collaborators approved the
  pull request.

- ``-merged`` matches if the pull requested has not been merged.

.. warning::

   The ``#`` character is considered as a comment delimiter in YAML. As ``#``
   is the length operator in Mergify's conditions system, don't forget to use
   ``"`` around the condition to write valid YAML syntax.

.. note::

  ``operator`` and ``value`` are only optional if the ``attribute`` type is
  ``Boolean``.

.. _Operators:

Operators
~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 2 1 3

   * - Operator Name
     - Symbol
     - Operator Description
   * - Equal
     - ``=`` or ``:``
     - This operator checks for strict equality. If the target attribute type
       is a list, each element of the list is compared against the value and
       the condition is true if any value matches.
   * - Not Equal
     - ``!=`` or ``â‰ ``
     - This operator checks for non equality. If the target attribute type
       is a list, each element of the list is compared against the value and
       the condition is true if no value matches.
   * - Match
     - ``~=``
     - This operator checks for regular expression matching. If the target
       attribute type is a list, each element of the list is matched
       against the value and the condition is true if any value matches.
   * - Greater Than or Equal
     - ``>=`` or ``â‰¥``
     - This operator checks for the value to be greater than or equal to the
       provided value. It's usually used to compare against the length of a
       list using the ``#`` prefix.
   * - Greater Than
     - ``>``
     - This operator checks for the value to be greater than the provided
       value. It's usually used to compare against the length of a list using
       the ``#`` prefix.
   * - Lesser Than or Equal
     - ``<=`` or ``â‰¤``
     - This operator checks for the value to be lesser then or equal to the
       provided value. It's usually used to compare against the length of a
       list using the ``#`` prefix.
   * - Lesser Than
     - ``<``
     - This operator checks for the value to be lesser than the provided value.
       It's usually used to compare against the length of a list using the
       ``#`` prefix.

.. tip::

   You can use `PyRegex <http://www.pyregex.com>`_ or `Pythex
   <https://pythex.org/>`_ to test your regular expression.


How To Match Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some attributes have a type of ``list``. Most `Operators`_ are able to match
value against lists: they will iterate over all the values of the list and
return true if any of the value matches.

For example, the ``label`` attribute is a list of string containing the names
of the label attached to a pull request. With a pull request whose labels are
``(bug, work-in-progress)``, then:

- ``label=work-in-progress`` is **true** because there is a label named
  ``work-in-progress``.

- ``label=enhancement`` is **false** because there is no label named
  ``enhancement``.

- ``label!=work-in-progress`` is **false** because there is a label named
  ``work-in-progress``.

- ``label~=^work`` is **true** because there is a label matching the regular
  expression ``^work``.

- ``-label~=^work`` is **false** because there is a label matching the regular
  expression ``^work`` but the condition is reversed with the ``-`` prefix.

The same applies for the ``files`` attribute â€” which contains the list of
modified files:

- ``files=README`` is **true** if the file ``README`` is modified in the pull
  request.

- ``files!=README`` is **true** if the file ``README`` is not modified in the
  pull request.

- ``files~=^src/`` is **true** if any files in the ``src`` directory is
  modified in the pull request.

- ``-files~=^src/`` is **true** if none of the files that are modified are in
  the ``src`` directory.


Implementing Or Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `conditions` do not support the `or` operation. As Mergify evaluates and
apply every matching rules from your configuration, you can implement multiple
rules in order to have this.

For example, to automatically merge a pull request if its author is ``foo`` or
``bar``, you could write:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pull_request_rules:
      - name: automatic merge if author is foo
        conditions:
          - author=foo
          - check-success=Travis CI - Pull Request
        actions:
          merge:
            method: merge

      - name: automatic merge if author is bar
        conditions:
          - author=bar
          - check-success=Travis CI - Pull Request
        actions:
          merge:
            method: merge


About Status Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generic Status Check
++++++++++++++++++++

When using the ``check-success``, ``check-neutral`` and ``check-failure``
conditions, you need to use the name of your check service. This can be find by
opening an existing pull request and scrolling down near the ``Merge`` button.

.. image:: _static/status-check-example.png
   :alt: Status check example

The name of the status check is written in bold on the left side. In the
example above, it should be ``Uno.UI - CI``. A condition that would make sure
this checks succeed before doing any action should be written as:

.. code-block:: yaml

     conditions:
       - check-success=Uno.UI - CI

GitHub Actions
++++++++++++++

GitHub Actions works slightly differently. To match a status check when using
GitHub Action, only the job name is used.

.. image:: _static/status-check-gh-example.png
   :alt: Status check GitHub Action example

In the example above, it would be ``A job to say hello``:

.. code-block:: yaml

     conditions:
       - check-success=A job to say hello

Validating All Status Check
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A common situation is to require a condition that is true when "every status
checks (CI) pass" â€” especially before executing the :ref:`merge action` action.

**There is no such thing as "every status check" in GitHub.**

Here's why:

1. Each pull request can have its own custom list of status check.
2. By default, a pull request has zero status check.
3. A status check might not be reported by a service (CI) (e.g., because it's
   broken) and therefore be totally absent.

Those three facts makes it **mandatory** to write explicitly the checks that
are expected for your condition to be valid. Therefore you should write
something like:

.. code-block:: yaml

     conditions:
       - check-success=build: Windows
       - check-success=build: Linux

**Do not** use conditions such as:

- ``#check-failure=0``, because this will be true as soon as the pull request is
  created and before any service report its status (see point 2. above).

- ``check-success~=build`` while expecting this to wait for all status checks
  that have ``build`` in their name (see point 1. above).

Such conditions won't do what you want them to do.
