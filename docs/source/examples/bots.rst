Some pull requests might be created automatically by other tools, such as the
ones sending automatic dependencies update. You might decide that there's no
need to manually review and approve those pull request as long as your
continuous integration system validates them.

The rules below are examples for such services: they are designed to
automatically merge those updates without human intervention if the continuous
integration system validates them. ``Travis CI - Pull Request`` is used as the
CI check name here â€” adjust it to whatever you use.
