.. _configuration file format:

=====================
🔖 Configuration File
=====================

File Used
---------

Mergify uses the configuration file that is:

- The file named ``.mergify.yml``, or, as a fallback, ``.mergify/config.yml`` or ``.github/mergify.yml``
  from the root directory.

- In the default repository branch configured on GitHub — usually ``main``.

Format
------

Here's what you need to know about the file format:

- The file format is `YAML <http://yaml.org/>`_.

- The file main type is a dictionary whose keys are named
  ``pull_request_rules``, ``queue_rules``, and ``defaults``.

Pull Request Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The value type of the ``pull_request_rules`` is list.

- Each entry in ``pull_request_rules`` must be a dictionary.

Each dictionary must have the following keys:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 1 2

   * - Key Name
     - Value Type
     - Value Description
   * - ``name``
     - string
     - The name of the rule. This is not used by the engine directly, but is
       used when reporting information about a rule.
   * - ``disabled``
     - dictionary with ``reason`` key
     - This optional key allows to disabled a rule and cancel any ongoing
       actions. A reason must be set using the ``reason`` key.
   * - ``conditions``
     - list of :ref:`Conditions`
     - A list of :ref:`Conditions` string that must match against the pull
       request for the rule to be applied.
   * - ``actions``
     - dictionary of :ref:`Actions`
     - A dictionary made of :ref:`Actions` that will be executed on the
       matching pull requests.

The rules are evaluated in the order they are defined in ``pull_request_rules``
and, therefore, the actions are executed in that same order.

See :ref:`Examples` for configuration file examples.

Queue Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~

- The value type of the ``queue_rules`` is list.

- Each entry in ``queue_rules`` must be a dictionary.

See :ref:`queue rules` for the complete list and description of options.

Defaults
~~~~~~~~

- The value type of ``defaults`` is a dictionary.

This dictionary must have the following key:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 1 2

   * - Key Name
     - Value Type
     - Value Description
   * - ``actions``
     - dictionary of :ref:`Actions`
     - A dictionary made of :ref:`Actions` whose configuration will be used by default.

The ``defaults`` section is used to define default configuration valued for actions run by pull request rules and by :ref:`Commands`.
If the options are defined in ``pull_request_rules`` they are used, otherwise, the values set in ``defaults`` are used.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  defaults:
    actions:
      comment:
        bot_account: Autobot

  pull_request_rules:
    - name: comment with default
      conditions:
        - label=comment
      actions:
        comment:
          message: I 💙 Mergify

The configuration above is the same as below:

.. code-block:: yaml

  pull_request_rules:
    - name: comment with default
      conditions:
        - label=comment
      actions:
        comment:
          message: I 💙 Mergify
          bot_account: Autobot

Data Types
----------

.. _regular expressions:

Regular Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use regular expression with matching :ref:`operators <Operators>` in
your :ref:`conditions <Conditions>` .

Mergify leverages `Python regular expressions
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>`_ to match rules.

.. tip::

   You can use `regex101 <https://regex101.com/>`_, `PyRegex
   <http://www.pyregex.com>`_ or `Pythex <https://pythex.org/>`_ to test your
   regular expressions.

Examples
++++++++

.. code-block:: yaml

    pull_request_rules:
      - name: add python label if a Python file is modified
        conditions:
          - files~=\.py$
        actions:
          label:
            add:
              - python

      - name: automatic merge for main when the title does not contain “WIP” (ignoring case)
        conditions:
          - base=main
          - -title~=(?i)wip
        actions:
          merge:
            method: merge

.. _time format:

Time
~~~~

This format represents the time of the day in the 24-hours format.
It can be used with any of the greater and lesser operators (``>=``, ``>``,
``<=``, ``<``).


.. code-block::

  current-time>=18:00[Europe/Paris
  schedule: Mon-Fri 09:00-19:00[America/Vancouver]
  schedule: Mon-Fri 09:00[Europe/Paris]-19:00[America/Vancouver]


Examples
++++++++

.. code-block:: yaml

      - name: comment after 18:00
        conditions:
          - current-time>=18:00
        actions:
          close:
            message: It's too late for this!
      - name: merge on working hour
        conditions:
          - schedule: Mon-Fri 09:00-19:00[America/Vancouver]
        actions:
          merge:


.. _iso timestamp:

Timestamp
~~~~~~~~~

The timestamp format must follow the `ISO 8601 standard
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_. If the timezone is missing, the
timestamp is assumed to be in UTC.

.. code-block::

   2021-04-05
   2012-09-17T22:02:51
   2008-09-22T14:01:54Z
   2013-12-05T07:19:04-08:00
   2013-12-05T07:19:04[Europe/Paris]

Examples
++++++++

.. code-block:: yaml

      - name: end of life version 10.0
        conditions:
          - base=stable/10.0
          - -closed
          - current-timestamp>=2021-04-05
        actions:
          close:
            message: |
              The pull request base branch has reached end-of-life.


.. _relative timestamp:

Relative Timestamp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Timestamps can be expressed relative to the current date and time.
The format is ``[DD days] [HH:MM] ago``:

* DD, the number of days
* HH, the number of hours
* MM, the number of minutes

If the current date is 18th June 2020, ``updated-at>=14 days ago`` will be translated ``updated-at>=2020-06-04T00:00:00``.

Examples
++++++++

.. code-block:: yaml

      - name: close stale pull request
        conditions:
          - base=main
          - -closed
          - updated-at<14 days ago
        actions:
          close:
            message: |
              This pull request looks stale. Feel free to reopen it if you think it's a mistake.


.. _duration:

Duration
~~~~~~~~

Duration can be expressed as ``quantity unit [quantity unit...]`` where
quantity is a number (possibly signed); unit is microsecond, millisecond,
second, minute, hour, day, week, or abbreviations or plurals of these units;

.. code-block::

   1 day 15 hours 6 minutes 42 seconds
   1 d 15 h 6 m 42 s



Disabling Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can disable a rule while keeping it in the configuration. This allows
gracefully handling the cancellation of any ongoing actions (e.g., like stopping
the merge queue).

Examples
++++++++

.. code-block:: yaml

      - name: automatic merge for main when the title does not contain “WIP” (ignoring case)
        disabled:
          reason: code freeze
        conditions:
          - base=main
          - -title~=(?i)wip
        actions:
          merge:
            method: merge

.. _data type template:


Template
~~~~~~~~

The template data type is a regular string that is rendered using the `Jinja2
template language <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/templates/>`_.

If you don't need any of the power coming with this templating language, you
can just use this as a regular string.

However, those templates allow to use any of the :ref:`pull request attribute
<attributes>` in the final string.

For example the template string:

.. code-block:: jinja

    Thank you @{{author}} for your contribution!

will render to:

.. code-block:: jinja

    Thank you @jd for your contribution!

when used in your configuration file — considering the pull request author
login is ``jd``.

`Jinja2 filters <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#builtin-filters>` are supported, you can build string from list for example with:

.. code-block:: jinja

    Approved by: @{{ approved-reviews-by | join(', @') }}

We also provide custom Jinja2 filters:

* ``markdownify``: to convert HTML to Markdown:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {{ body | markdownify }}

* ``get_section(<section>, <default>)``: to extract one Markdown section

.. code-block:: jinja

    {{ body | get_section("## Description") }}

.. note::

   You need to replace the ``-`` character by ``_`` from the :ref:`pull request
   attribute <attributes>` names when using templates. The ``-`` is not a valid
   character for variable names in Jinja2 template.

.. note::

   By default, the HTML comments are stripped from ``body``. To get the
   full body, you can use the ``body_raw`` attribute.

Validation
----------

Changes to the configuration file should be done via a pull request in order
for Mergify to validate it via a GitHub check.

However, if you want to validate your configuration file before sending a pull
request, you can use the following command line:

.. code:: bash

    $ curl -F 'data=@.mergify.yml' https://engine.mergify.io/validate


Or by uploading the configuration file with this form:

.. raw:: html

    <form method=post enctype=multipart/form-data action=https://engine.mergify.io/validate target=_blank>
      <input type=file name=data>
      <input type=submit value=Validate>
    </form>
