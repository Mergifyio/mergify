 Configuration File Format
===========================

The configuration file for Mergify should be named ``.mergify.yml`` and must be
placed in the root directory of your GitHub repository. Mergify uses the
default repository branch configured on GitHub to read the configuration file â€”
usually ``master``. The file format is `YAML <http://yaml.org/>`_.

The file main entry is a dictionary whose key is named ``pull_request_rules``.
The value of the ``pull_request_rules`` key must be a list of dictionary.

Each dictionary must have the following keys:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 1 2

   * - Key Name
     - Value Type
     - Value Description
   * - ``name``
     - string
     - The name of the rule. This is not used by the engine directly, but is
       used when reporting information about a rule.
   * - ``conditions``
     - array of :ref:`Conditions`
     - A list of :ref:`Conditions` string that must match against the pull
       request for the rule to be applied.
   * - ``actions``
     - dictionary of :ref:`Actions`
     - A dictionary made of :ref:`Actions` that will be executed on the
       matching pull requests.

The rules are evaluated in the order they are defined and, therefore, the
actions are executed in that same order.

Example
=======

Here's a simple example of a configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pull_request_rules:
      - name: automatic merge when CI passes and 2 reviews
        conditions:
          - "#approved-reviews-by>=2"
          - status-success=Travis CI - Pull Request
          - base=master
        actions:
          merge:
            method: merge

See :ref:`Examples` for more examples.

Validation
==========

Usually ``.mergify.yml`` configuration change should be done via a pull
request, in order for Mergify to validate it.

However if you are creating the initial configuration or want to validate it
locally before sending a pull request, you can use:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd <my_project>
    $ curl -F 'data=@.mergify.yml' https://gh.mergify.io/validate


Or by uploading the configuration file with this form:

.. raw:: html

    <form method=post enctype=multipart/form-data action=https://gh.mergify.io/validate target=_blank>
      <input type=file name=data>
      <input type=submit value=Validate>
    </form>
